# Challenge 3: Needle in a Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle", which you need to find.

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says: "Found the needle at position x", with x being the index number at which you find the needle.

So:

```js
var haystack = ['hay', 'rabbit', 'needle', 'hat'];

findNeedle();
```

Should return:

```js
'Found the needle at position 2'
```
