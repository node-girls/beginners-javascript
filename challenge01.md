# Challenge 1: Age Difference

Write a function `ageDifference` that returns the difference in age between the oldest and youngest member of a family.

It should take two parameters: `youngest`, and `oldest`. These will always be objects. Use the following two as your test cases:

```js
var youngest = {
  name: 'Maya',
  age: 13
};

var oldest = {
  name: 'Joy',
  age: 83
};
```

Successfully calling the function will look like this:

```js
ageDifference(youngest, oldest); // ---> returns 70
```
